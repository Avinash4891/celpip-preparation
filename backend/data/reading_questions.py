Subject: Exciting News — We Are Moving to Calgary!

Hi Sandra,

I hope this email finds you well! I have been meaning to write for a while now, but things have been absolutely hectic on our end. I am thrilled to share some exciting — and slightly overwhelming — news: our family is relocating to Calgary, Alberta, at the end of next month.

As you know, David has been working remotely for Tectonic Energy Solutions for the past two years. Last week, they offered him a full-time, in-office senior engineering position at their Calgary headquarters. The salary increase is significant, and the career growth opportunity is simply too good to pass up. After a lot of discussion, we decided this was the right move for our family, even though leaving Toronto is not easy for any of us.

The children are taking the news in stride, mostly. Owen, who just started Grade 7, is a little anxious about switching schools mid-year, but we found a highly rated school only minutes from the neighbourhood we are looking at. Emma, on the other hand, is already excited — she has been watching videos about the Rocky Mountains and keeps asking when we can go hiking. Kids are resilient, I suppose.

As for me, I will be leaving my position at Maple Grove Design at the end of the month. My manager was understanding, thankfully. I plan to take a few weeks to settle the family in before looking for freelance interior design work in Calgary. The city is booming with new residential construction, so I am cautiously optimistic about prospects there.

The hardest part is leaving behind friends and community here in Toronto. You have been such a wonderful friend, Sandra, and I truly hope we can stay in touch. Perhaps you could even visit once we are settled — I hear Calgary summers are gorgeous!

We have a moving company booked for March 22nd. If you are free before then, I would love to get together for coffee and a proper goodbye.

With much love and a little bit of nerves,
Patricia

THE URBAN FOREST: WHY TREES ARE ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN CANADIAN CITIES

[A]
City planners and environmental scientists have long understood that trees are not merely decorative additions to urban landscapes. In recent years, however, municipal governments across Canada have begun to treat the urban forest — the collective canopy of trees in a city — as genuine critical infrastructure, on par with roads, water systems, and electrical grids. This shift in thinking reflects a growing body of evidence showing that trees provide measurable economic, environmental, and social benefits that far exceed the cost of planting and maintaining them. Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal have each launched ambitious urban forestry strategies, investing tens of millions of dollars in canopy expansion and protection over the past decade.

[B]
Perhaps the most quantifiable benefit of urban trees is their role in managing stormwater. When rain falls on hard surfaces such as pavement and rooftops, it flows rapidly into storm drains, often overwhelming municipal water systems and causing flooding. Trees interrupt this process: their canopies intercept rainfall, their roots absorb water from the soil, and the organic matter they produce increases the soil's capacity to retain moisture. Research conducted by the David Suzuki Foundation estimated that a single mature urban tree can intercept as much as 3,800 litres of rainwater annually. Across a city with millions of trees, this represents an enormous reduction in the burden placed on engineered stormwater infrastructure.

[C]
Urban trees also play a critical role in moderating temperature in the face of the urban heat island effect — a well-documented phenomenon in which cities become significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of heat-absorbing surfaces and reduced vegetation. Studies of Canadian cities show that densely treed neighbourhoods can be as much as five to eight degrees Celsius cooler on hot summer days than adjacent neighbourhoods with sparse canopy cover. This cooling effect reduces the energy demand for air conditioning, which in turn lowers both household electricity bills and citywide greenhouse gas emissions. During heatwaves, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, shaded streets and parks can also be life-saving for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.

[D]
Beyond their environmental functions, trees have well-documented effects on human mental health and community cohesion. A growing body of research in environmental psychology has found that access to green space — including tree-lined streets and urban parks — is associated with lower rates of anxiety, depression, and stress-related illnesses. Residents of neighbourhoods with abundant street trees report higher levels of satisfaction with their community and greater feelings of safety. Some urban planners have begun to incorporate green infrastructure, including tree canopy targets, into broader public health strategies, recognizing that the distribution of trees across a city is a social equity issue: lower-income neighbourhoods have historically had significantly less canopy cover than wealthier ones, a disparity that cities like Hamilton and Edmonton are actively working to address.

THE DEBATE OVER MANDATORY VOTING IN CANADA

VIEWPOINT 1 — THE CASE FOR MANDATORY VOTING
by James Okafor, Political Science Lecturer, University of Ottawa

Canada's voter turnout has been in long-term decline. In the 2021 federal election, only 62.6 percent of registered voters cast a ballot — a troubling indicator of a democracy that is slowly losing the engagement of its citizens. Proponents of mandatory voting, a system used successfully in Australia and more than twenty other countries worldwide, argue that it is the most direct solution to this crisis of civic participation.

The core argument is straightforward: voting is not merely a right but a civic duty, akin to paying taxes or serving on a jury. A healthy democracy requires the active participation of all its citizens, not just those motivated enough to show up. When large segments of the population do not vote — disproportionately the young, the poor, and marginalized communities — elected governments do not truly represent the population as a whole. Mandatory voting corrects this distortion.

Critics often claim that forcing people to vote infringes on individual freedom. But we already compel citizens to perform many civic duties. More importantly, mandatory voting systems typically allow voters to submit a blank or informal ballot, meaning no one is ever forced to endorse a candidate they do not support. Australia has operated such a system since 1924, with turnout consistently above 90 percent and no credible evidence that individual liberties have been compromised.

The evidence from countries with mandatory voting shows that it produces more representative governments, reduces the outsized influence of well-funded mobilization efforts, and encourages political parties to develop policies that appeal to the entire population rather than simply to reliable voting blocs. In an era of growing political polarization and populism, Canada would benefit enormously from this reform.

VIEWPOINT 2 — AGAINST MANDATORY VOTING
by Dr. Miriam Holt, Senior Fellow, Canadian Democracy Institute

The proposal to introduce mandatory voting in Canada rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of what a healthy democracy requires. Advocates point to Australia's high turnout figures as evidence of success, but turnout alone is a poor proxy for civic health. A democracy does not become more legitimate simply because more people are legally coerced into marking a ballot.

The right to vote is inseparable from the right not to vote. Compulsion transforms a voluntary expression of political agency into an administrative obligation, fundamentally altering the relationship between citizen and state. If we are concerned about low turnout, the appropriate response is to remove barriers to participation — through automatic voter registration, expanded advance polling, and making Election Day a national holiday — not to penalize abstention.

There is also the question of informed participation. Mandatory voting inevitably brings to the polls a significant number of people who have chosen not to engage with political issues. Research from political scientists, including work by Arend Lijphart and more recent comparative studies, suggests that uninformed compelled voters are more susceptible to last-minute, emotionally driven campaign messaging and random ballot choices. Quality of participation matters, not just quantity.

Furthermore, the comparison to Australia is less flattering on closer inspection. Australia's preferential voting system and the presence of informal ballots complicate straightforward comparisons with Canadian elections. What works within one political culture and institutional framework cannot simply be transplanted to another.

Canada's declining turnout is a real problem, but it is a symptom of deeper disengagement. Mandatory voting treats the symptom while leaving the disease — political alienation, lack of trust in institutions, and inadequate civic education — entirely unaddressed.
